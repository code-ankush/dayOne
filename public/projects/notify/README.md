Motivation:
	When i look at the push book of Addy, i didn't able to understant why he included too many big paragraphs, ever if i need just one extra feature i need to go throught all those again and again, so i decided to make my own version which only i can understand


Steps to run this one one your machine:

	1. Make firebase project.
	2. Deploy every file of this project specially functions folder(if you are running locally on your server)
	3. Allow notification in Chrome(Canary recommendate)
	4. Enjoy the flow of bugs.
	5. Better code is always appreciated
